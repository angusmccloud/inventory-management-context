# Shared Agent Context

This file is the **single source of truth** for manual additions to all AI agent context files.

Any content added here will be synchronized to:
- `CLAUDE.md` (Roo Code)
- `.cursor/rules/specify-rules.mdc` (Cursor IDE)
- `.github/agents/copilot-instructions.md` (GitHub Copilot)

## Manual Additions

<!-- Add your shared context below this line -->

## Build Tool & Deployment

- **Frontend Build Tool**: Vite (NOT Webpack or Next.js built-in bundler)
- **Frontend Deployment**: AWS S3 + CloudFront (NOT Vercel or other platforms)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (uses Vite)
- **Output Directory**: `dist/` (configured in `vite.config.ts`)

## Project-Specific Guidelines

- Always use Zod for input validation at API boundaries
- Follow the constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
- DynamoDB queries MUST use indexes (no table scans allowed)
- All code MUST be TypeScript 5 with strict mode enabled

## Common Patterns

### Frontend Development
- Use Vite for fast HMR during development
- Configure path aliases in `vite.config.ts`
- Environment variables must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` or `VITE_`
- Build output goes to `dist/` directory

### Authentication
- All API endpoints require JWT Bearer token from AWS Cognito
- Family context (`familyId`) is extracted from JWT `custom:familyId` claim
- Role-based access control: `admin` (full access) or `suggester` (read + suggest)
- Lambda authorizer validates JWT and injects context

### DynamoDB Access
- Use single-table design pattern
- All queries filter by `familyId` for family isolation
- Use GSI2 for low-stock queries and shopping list filtering
- Never use table scans (always query with proper indexes)

### Error Handling
- Use structured error responses with Zod validation errors
- Include correlation IDs in all errors for tracing
- Log errors with CloudWatch structured JSON format
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 500)

### Deployment
- Frontend: Deploy to S3, invalidate CloudFront cache
- Backend: Deploy via AWS SAM (`sam deploy`)
- Always run tests before deployment
- Use environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, prod)
