  title: Member Management API
  description: |
    RESTful API for managing family members and invitations. This API extends the Family Inventory 
    Management System with member management functionality.
    
    **Feature**: 003-member-management  
    **Parent Feature**: 016-family-inventory-mvp
    
    ## Authorization
    - Most endpoints require JWT authentication via AWS Cognito
    - Admin-only operations: invite members, revoke invitations, update roles, remove members
    - All family members can view member lists
    - Invitation acceptance is public (token-based authentication)
    
    ## Role-Based Access Control
    
    | Operation | Admin | Suggester |
    |-----------|-------|-----------|
    | Create invitation | ✓ | ✗ |
    | List invitations | ✓ | ✗ |
    | Revoke invitation | ✓ | ✗ |
    | Accept invitation | Public (token-based) | Public (token-based) |
    | List members | ✓ | ✓ |
    | Get member details | ✓ | ✓ |
    | Update member role | ✓ | ✗ |
    | Remove member | ✓ | ✗ |
    
    ## Optimistic Locking
    Update and remove operations require a `version` field for concurrency control.
    On conflict, the API returns 409 with the current member state.
    
    ## Last Admin Protection
    The system prevents:
    - Removing the last admin from a family
    - Changing the last admin's role to suggester

      summary: Create member invitation
      description: |
        Create and send an invitation to add a new member to the family.
        
        **Authorization**: Admin role required.
        
        **Duplicate Prevention**: If an invitation already exists for the same email 
        with status 'pending', returns 409 Conflict.
        
        **Email Delivery**: An invitation email is sent to the invitee with a secure 
        invitation link. The link expires after 7 days.
        
        **Token Security**: The invitation token uses UUID.HMAC format for tamper protection.

      summary: Accept invitation
      description: |
        Accept an invitation and join the family. This is a public endpoint that uses 
        token-based authentication instead of JWT.
        
        **Authentication**: Token-based (no JWT required)
        
        **Token Validation**:
        - Token must be valid and not expired
        - Token signature is verified using HMAC-SHA256
        - Token is single-use (invitation status changes to 'accepted')
        
        **Side Effects**:
        - Creates a new Cognito user account (if not exists)
        - Creates a Member record in DynamoDB
        - Updates invitation status to 'accepted'
        
        **Note**: If the user already has a Cognito account with the invitation email,
        they will be linked to the family without creating a new account.

      description: |
        Remove a member from the family. The member's status is set to 'removed' 
        (soft delete) and their access is revoked immediately.
        
        **Authorization**: Admin role required.
        
        **Optimistic Locking**: Include the current `version` in the request body.
        On conflict, returns 409 with the current member state.
        
        **Last Admin Protection**: Cannot remove the last admin from the family.
        The system ensures at least one admin exists at all times.
        
        **Self-Removal**: Admins can remove themselves if another admin exists.
        
        **Data Integrity**: Items created by the removed member (inventory items, 
        shopping list items, suggestions) are preserved with references to the 
        removed member.
